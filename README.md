# Quantum Experiments Repository

Welcome to my Quantum Experiments Repository! This space serves as a platform where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experimental proposals related to quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum cryptography.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find detailed PDF documents that present theoretical frameworks, experimental setups, and data analyses within the realm of quantum studies. 
The aim is to explore novel concepts and experimental approaches that can potentially reshape our understanding of quantum mechanics.

### What's Inside

- **Entanglement Experiment**: This document explores the extension of the uncertainty principle to include separability, proposing a novel entanglement experiment.
- **Double-Slit Experiment**: A proposed experiment that incorporates infinite paths, offering new insights into the quantum-classic duality observed in reality.
- **Interaction-Free Measurement**: An experiment utilizing interaction-free measurements with infinite paths, aimed at studying the complementarity principle in extreme limits.

## Purpose

The purpose of placing these PDFs here is to share my ongoing work and thoughts with others interested in quantum research. Whether you are a fellow researcher, a student, or simply curious about quantum mechanics, you will find these experiments both intriguing and informative.

## Caution

Please note that the content in this repository represents my personal exploration into the field of quantum mechanics. These documents and ideas are subject to change as my understanding evolves. This repository is not intended as a definitive source for teaching quantum mechanics but rather as a personal intellectual journey shared with the public.

## Contact

If you have questions, suggestions, or want to discuss any of the experiments further, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find the experiments as fascinating as I do!
